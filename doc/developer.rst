Developer information
=====================

We use drone.io for continuous integration:
https://drone.io/github.com/dib-lab/sourmash/

Code coverage calculation is enabled (on Linux only) by running
'make coverage'.  This recompiles the C++ extension without
optimization and with coverage configured.  See 'setup.py' for
more information on this.

Code coverage can be viewed interactively at codecov.io:
